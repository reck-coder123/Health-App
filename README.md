# Health Report Project

This project is a simple web application that allows users to submit their health reports (PDF files) along with their details, which are then stored in a MySQL database. The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Install a local development environment such as XAMPP or WAMP, which includes PHP and MySQL.

3. Create a new database in MySQL for the project and import the `database.sql` file provided.

4. Place the project files in the web server's root directory or a subdirectory, depending on your server configuration.

5. Update the database connection details in the `insert.php` and `fetch.php` files with your MySQL credentials.

6. Make sure the `uploads` directory has write permissions so that the uploaded health reports can be saved.

## Starting the Project

1. Start the local development environment (e.g., XAMPP or WAMP) and make sure the Apache and MySQL services are running.

2. Open a web browser and navigate to the project URL (e.g., `http://localhost/health-report-project`).

## Additional Notes

- The project includes client-side form validation using HTML5 attributes and JavaScript, but it's always recommended to implement server-side validation as well.

- You can customize the project by modifying the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP files as per your requirements.

- Remember to secure the project in a production environment by implementing appropriate security measures, such as input sanitization and user authentication.

- Feel free to contribute to the project by submitting pull requests or suggesting improvements.
